Hangboard Methodz
Scott here. Learning web development. For my first project I want to develop an app where a user can track their hangboard workouts, use different hangboard protocols, sync their workouts with their sends (by users entering their ticks/sends directly into the app or linking it with already existing log apps, e.g. 8a.nu, 27crags, Island.io, etc.)
